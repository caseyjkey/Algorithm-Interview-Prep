I've created a comprehensive README.md for the Algorithm-Interview-Prep repository. The document includes:

**Key Sections:**
- **Overview** with CTCI context and optimization focus
- **Problem Categories** organized by data structures and techniques
- **Getting Started** with prerequisites and usage instructions
- **Complexity Analysis** reference table with Big-O notations
- **Problems by Chapter** mapped to actual files with time/space complexity
- **Technical Deep Dive** analyzing 6 key implementations:
  - In-place algorithms (16-1.py)
  - Linked list recursion (10-1.py)
  - File I/O optimization (12-1.cpp)
  - Hash set vs bit vector (1-1.py)
  - Brute force vs optimized approaches (16-10.py)
  - Constant-time bit operations
- **Design Patterns** table for common interview techniques
- **TODO** with prioritized improvement roadmap
- **Complexity Reference Table** for data structures

The markdown uses professional formatting with tables, code blocks, and clear hierarchical structure suitable for technical interview preparation.
